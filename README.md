# Two Axis Object Tracking Camera

This was the final project submission for my Robotics Sensing and Navigation class in the Spring of 2024. It consisted of a standard USB webcam mounted on two servos to allow for pan and tilt motion. OpenCV was used for the object detection and it sent simple serial commands to the Arduino controlling the two servos.
